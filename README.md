Development
===========

ConnectionKit 2 is still under heavy development, but the front-end API is probably stable.

Things someone could do if they're feeling nice:

* Cancellation support for the File protocol
* Improve handling of invalid certificates for FTPS
* Amazon S3 protocol
* Port `CKUploader` to the new API
* API for downloading/reading files

Features
========

ConnectionKit provides a Cocoa-friendly, block-based API for asynchronously working with:

* FTP, SFTP and WebDAV servers
* Local files

Contributors and Contact Info

I'm Mike Abdullah, of [Karelia Software](http://karelia.com). [@mikeabdullah](http://twitter.com/mikeabdullah) on Twitter.

Questions about the code are best left as issues at https://github.com/karelia/ConnectionKit but you can also message me on Twitter (just don't expect more than a terse reply!).

Big thanks to:

* Sam Deane for:
	* Sooo much testing, especially Mock Server
	* The WebDAV protocol implementation
	* Improving the File protocol implementation
* And all contributors to the submodules of course!

Dependencies
============

Requires OS X v10.6+

Relies upon CURLHandle and DAVKit. They are provided as submodules and may have their own dependencies in turn. Out of the box, provided you initialise all submodules, `CURLHandle.framework` should be able to nicely build, self-containing all its dependencies.

License
=======

### CURLHandle

Please see https://github.com/karelia/CurlHandle for details of CURLHandle and its subcomponents' licensing.

### DAVKit

Please see https://github.com/karelia/DAVKit for details of CURLHandle and its subcomponents' licensing.

### Legacy

Existing ConnectionKit code should declare its licensing at the top of the file, most likely BSD or MIT.

Usage
=====

### Getting the code

1. Clone the ConnectionKit repository, ideally by adding it as a submodule if you're using git for your main project
2. Checkout the `curlhandle-4` branch
3. Initialise all submodules â€” they go several levels deep!
4. Add `Connection.xcodeproj` to your project
5. Add the ConnectionKit framework as a dependency of your project's build target
6. Set `Connection.framework` to be copied into a suitable location inside your build target; e.g the `Frameworks` directory

### Actually, y'know, doing stuff

1. Create a `CK2FileManager` instance
2. Set the file manager's delegate if you require control over authentication, or to receive transcripts
3. Instruct the file manager to do the thing what it is you want to do.

Be sure to read through `CK2FileManager.h` as there's plenty of helpful documentation in there.
